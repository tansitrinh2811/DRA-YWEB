# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx
npx hardhat test

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
